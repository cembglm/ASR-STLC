        "analysis": "The requirement definition and scope section is well-structured, but some aspects could be improved. The functional requirements are clearly defined, including ID, description, priority, and type (Functional/Non-Functional). However, the non-functional requirements are not as detailed, with only a brief description of performance, scalability, compatibility, and security. Additionally, there is no clear prioritization or critical success criteria (CSC) established. To improve this section, it would be beneficial to provide more detailed descriptions for non-functional requirements and establish clear CSCs."

        "analysis": "The requirement quality is generally good, but there are some gaps. The requirements are testable, with specific metrics provided for performance and scalability. However, the consistency of requirements could be improved, as some sections seem to contradict each other. Additionally, a traceability matrix or another mechanism to track dependencies between requirements would enhance the overall quality. To improve this section, it would be beneficial to address these inconsistencies and establish a clear traceability process."

        "analysis": "The risk assessment is limited, with only security measures mentioned. However, the scalability of the system could be improved by defining well-defined strategies for handling large amounts of data and concurrent users. Additionally, error handling and feedback mechanisms should be clearly defined to ensure a smooth user experience. To improve this section, it would be beneficial to provide more detailed risk assessments and define clear strategies for scalability and error handling."

        "analysis": "The conclusion and recommendations are generally good, but some aspects could be improved. The requirement document complies with ISTQB standards, but there are missing details regarding administrative controls, system integration, or future extensibility. Additionally, the tool's performance could be improved by addressing scalability issues and providing more detailed error handling mechanisms. To improve this section, it would be beneficial to provide clear recommendations for improving these aspects."

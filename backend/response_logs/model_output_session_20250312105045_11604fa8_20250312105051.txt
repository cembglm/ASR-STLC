        "analysis": "The requirement definition and scope are clearly defined in the document. The functional and technical requirements are outlined, including user roles, data entry methods, permission levels, and CSCs. However, there is no clear explanation of how CSCs will be measured throughout the development process. Additionally, some sections like 'Non-Functional Requirements' could be more detailed."

        "score": 7/10,
        "analysis": "The requirements are mostly complete and clear, but there are some gaps in terms of testability, modifiability, and traceability. The document mentions specific quality metrics like load time and response time, but it would be beneficial to have more detailed information on these aspects. There is also a lack of clarity regarding the dependencies between requirements."

However, it would be beneficial to have more specific suggestions for improving traceability and testability in the development process. Additionally, there are some missing details regarding administrative controls, system integration, or future extensibility."

However, some requirements are missing or ambiguous, such as user roles, data entry methods, and permission levels. Additionally, there is no clear explanation of how critical success criteria (CSCs) will be defined and measured throughout the development process."

For example, the non-functional requirements section does not provide detailed information on performance, scalability, or security measures. Furthermore, there is no explicit mention of how testability, modifiability, and traceability will be ensured throughout the development process."

There is no clear explanation of how to handle large amounts of data or concurrent users. Additionally, the security measures mentioned are not explicitly specified, which raises concerns about the overall security of the system."

It does not address any major issues or provide concrete suggestions for enhancing traceability, testability, or risk management in the development process."

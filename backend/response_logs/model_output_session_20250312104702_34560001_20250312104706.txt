The functional and technical requirements are listed, along with non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, compatibility, and security. However, some of the requirements could be more detailed and prioritized. Additionally, there is no clear explanation of how the system will handle large amounts of data or concurrent users."

        "analysis": "The requirements are mostly complete and clear, but some gaps exist. For example, there is no clear definition of what constitutes a critical success criterion (CSC). The system should also consider testability, modifiability, and traceability when designing the requirements. Furthermore, some requirements contradict each other, such as the need for both performance and security measures."

However, there is no clear strategy for handling large amounts of data or concurrent users. Additionally, the system should consider other risks such as API security and user notifications. The risk assessment could be more comprehensive and detailed."

The recommendations include improving traceability and testability in the development process, as well as adding support for additional output formats such as CSV."

        "analysis": "The requirement definition and scope section is well-structured, providing clear guidelines on the tool's purpose, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, technical architecture, and future improvements. However, some sections, such as the project name and summary, are not explicitly defined in terms of their priority or importance. Additionally, there is no clear indication of how the system will handle conflicting requirements or missing data."

        "analysis": "The requirement quality section highlights the importance of completeness, clarity, consistency, testability, modifiability, and traceability. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that some requirements are missing or ambiguous, such as user roles, data entry methods, and permission levels. Furthermore, there is no clear mechanism for tracking dependencies between requirements or ensuring that all critical success criteria (CSCs) are established."

        "analysis": "The risk assessment section identifies potential risks related to security, performance, error handling, and scalability. However, the strategies for addressing these risks are not explicitly outlined. For example, there is no clear plan for handling large amounts of data or concurrent users, which could impact system performance. Additionally, the security measures mentioned, such as encryption and brute-force attack prevention, are not adequately specified."

        "analysis": "The conclusion and recommendations section provides some useful insights into areas for improvement, such as adding support for additional output formats (e.g., CSV) and allowing users to specify custom file paths. However, the section could benefit from more detailed recommendations for addressing the identified risks and improving the overall quality of the requirements. Additionally, there is no clear indication of how the system will be tested or validated to ensure its effectiveness."

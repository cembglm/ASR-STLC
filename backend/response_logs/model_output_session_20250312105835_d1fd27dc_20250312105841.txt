        "analysis": "The requirement definition and scope section is well-structured, providing clear guidelines on the tool's purpose and functionality. However, some sections are missing, such as user roles, data entry methods, and permission levels. The prioritization of requirements and establishment of critical success criteria (CSC) are also not explicitly mentioned. Overall, the document provides a good foundation for requirement definition and scope but requires further clarification on certain aspects."

        "analysis": "The requirements evaluation is based on completeness, clarity, consistency, testability, modifiability, and traceability. However, some gaps are identified, such as missing links between requirements and lack of specific quality metrics. The document also mentions contradicting requirements but does not provide a clear plan for addressing these issues. A more detailed analysis of the requirements' quality is necessary to ensure that they meet the necessary standards."

        "analysis": "The risk assessment section identifies potential risks related to security, performance, error handling, and scalability. However, the strategies for addressing these risks are not clearly defined. The document mentions that the system should handle reasonable file sizes efficiently without performance degradation but does not provide specific measures for ensuring scalability. A more comprehensive risk assessment plan is required to mitigate potential risks."

The document should provide more detailed recommendations for addressing identified gaps in requirement definition, quality, risk assessment, and scalability. Additionally, a clear plan for implementing these recommendations is necessary to ensure that the tool meets the required standards."

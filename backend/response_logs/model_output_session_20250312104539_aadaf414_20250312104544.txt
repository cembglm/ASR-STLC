However, some sections are missing, such as user roles, data entry methods, permission levels, and future extensibility details. The CSCs are not explicitly defined, which may lead to confusion during development."

        "analysis": "The requirements are generally complete and clear, but there are some gaps in terms of testability, modifiability, and traceability. The tool does not provide specific quality metrics for load time, response time, or UI usability metrics. There is also a lack of information on how to handle large amounts of data and concurrent users. The requirements contradict each other in some cases, and there are missing links between them."

        "analysis": "The risk assessment section is limited, only mentioning security, performance, error handling, and scalability risks. However, the strategies for handling large amounts of data and concurrent users are not well-defined. Security measures such as encryption and API security are mentioned but not adequately specified. Error handling and feedback mechanisms are also unclear."

However, it lacks specific details on administrative controls, system integration, or future extensibility. The document does not comply with ISTQB standards, and there are missing details regarding user roles, data entry methods, permission levels, and future extensibility."

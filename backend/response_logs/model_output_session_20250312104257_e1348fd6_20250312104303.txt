        "analysis": "The requirement definition and scope section is well-defined, covering the purpose of the tool, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, technical architecture, libraries, file formats, data flow, component breakdown, example workflow, error handling, testing, and future improvements. However, some sections could be more detailed, such as the specific requirements for scalability and security. The document also lacks a clear definition of critical success criteria (CSCs) and how they will be measured throughout the development process."

        "score": 7/10,
        "analysis": "The requirement quality section is adequate, covering completeness, clarity, consistency, testability, modifiability, and traceability. However, some requirements seem to contradict each other (e.g., the need for scalability vs. potential performance degradation). The document also lacks specific quality metrics or a traceability matrix to track dependencies between requirements. Additionally, there are missing links between functional and non-functional requirements."

        "score": 6/10,
        "analysis": "The risk assessment section is limited, only mentioning critical risks regarding security, performance, error handling, and scalability. However, the document lacks a clear strategy for handling large amounts of data and concurrent users. Security measures are also not adequately specified, with no mention of encryption or brute-force attack prevention. Error handling mechanisms are unclear, with no specific details on user notifications, logging, or reporting mechanisms."

        "analysis": "The conclusion and recommendations section is adequate, highlighting the need for improved traceability and testability in the development process. However, some aspects are missing, such as administrative controls, system integration, or future extensibility. The document also lacks a clear definition of how to improve scalability and security measures. Overall, the requirements seem to be well-defined, but there is room for improvement in terms of detail and specificity."
